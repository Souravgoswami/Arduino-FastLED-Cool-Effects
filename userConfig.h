 * General Configuration
 *
 * This section contains foundational settings that define the core aspects of the LED display system.
 * These configurations are crucial for the initial setup and proper operation of the LED strip,
 * ensuring that the hardware and software components communicate effectively. Each setting is adjustable
 * to accommodate various types of LED strips, wiring setups, and user preferences.
 * It is essential to tailor these parameters to match your specific hardware configuration
 * and desired operational characteristics.
