/**
 * Creates a smooth, continuously morphing rainbow effect across an LED strip.
 * This function generates a dynamic rainbow pattern that subtly shifts in color and brightness over time,
 * creating a visually captivating display. It utilizes a combination of linear and sinusoidal interpolations
 * to blend hues and morph the colors smoothly, ensuring a seamless transition throughout the LED strip.
 *
 * @param wait The delay in milliseconds between each frame, controlling the speed of the animation.
 *             A lower value results in a faster animation, while a higher value slows it down.
 * @param numLEDs The number of LEDs in the strip. This function dynamically adjusts to accommodate
 *                any strip length, ensuring the pattern scales correctly across different sizes.
 *
 * Usage Example:
 *    rainbowWave(20, NUM_LEDS); // Call this in the main loop to animate the rainbow wave with a 20ms frame delay.
